  <p class="p1"><em class="em1">HEY THERE</em>, I would like to share the works that I had completed  in HSCL :)</p>
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>Trig ratios </li>
    <li>Forces on the Incline planes</li>
    <li>Fashion Design on Canva</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Trig ratios <h2>
    
    <img class="img2" src="https://www.onlinemathlearning.com/image-files/trig-ratios.png" alt="An example of trig ratio of diagrams." />
   
     <p class="p2">These are the ratios you use to solve the trig equations. I learned to use these ratios When you are given a right triangle and where two of the side lengths are given and you are asked to find the third side. Then, you would use SOH CAH TAO.</p>

     <p class="p2">This is a design I created in class for tecnology class.We learned how to be creative using this website into many designs of your own choice. </p>
   
      <li>Forces on the Incline planes</li>
    
     <img class="img2" src=" https://stickmanphysics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Incline-Plane.jpg"  
          
           <p class="p2">This is a topic we covered in Physics class. Its the force required to move an object up the incline is less than the weight being raised, discounting friction.The steeper the slope, or incline, the more nearly the required force approaches the actual weight. </p>
